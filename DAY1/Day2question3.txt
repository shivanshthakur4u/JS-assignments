JavaScript is a dynamic or loosely-typed language because a variable can hold value of any data type at any point of time.

There are five types of primitive data types in JavaScript. They are as follows:


1.String:represents sequence of characters e.g. "hello"

2.Number:represents numeric values e.g. 100

3.Boolean:represents boolean value either false or true

4.Undefined:represents undefined value

5.Null:represents null i.e. no value at all

Non-primitive Data type

1.Object:represents instance through which we can access members

2.Array:represents group of similar values

3.RegExp:represents regular expression
