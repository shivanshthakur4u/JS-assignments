1.var – Can be re-assigned, re-defined and has a function-scope. When declared outside the function, it has a global scope and attaches itself to the window object.
example 1:(scope within the function)
function begin () {
 for (var i=0; i<5; i++) {
  console.log(i) 
 }
// i is accessible outside the for loop
 console.log(i)
}
example 2:(global scope)
var name = 'Saurabh';

2.let – Can be re-assigned. It’s scope is within a block of code.
example 1:(scope not outside the for)

function begin () {
 for (let i=0; i<5; i++) {
  console.log(i) 
 }
// i is not defined and will return an error
 console.log(i)
}

3.const – Cannot be re-assigned or re-defined. It’s scope is within a block of code.
example 1:

const name = 'Aditi';
let age = 25;
age = 27;
// cannot re-assign name. will throw error
name = 'Avashya';
